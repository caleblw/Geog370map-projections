    <h1>Homework 8: Employment Data of Virginia in 2018 comparisons</h1>
    <h1>Caleb Willis</h1>
    <h2>This map was created with the Equal Interval mode. This is not the best method of displaying the data becuase it does not show good variation across virginia. It appears that there are only a few areas that have a lot of jobs and all other areas having very few in comparison.</h2>

     <h2>This map was created with the Natural breaks mode. This is a much better than the prior projection because it shows a much better distinction between areas of relatively low employment, areas of high employment, as well as the areas in between.</h2>

     <h2>This map was created with the Logerithmic mode. This mehtod gives the best distinction between the areas with relatively intermidiate levels of employment, when compared to the other maps. This is apparent when observing the area between Pittsylvania and the Cheasapeak area. As you can see some counties are distigished here that are not in the otehr two maps.</h2>
