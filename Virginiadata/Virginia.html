    <h1>Homework 7: Employment Data of Virginia in 2018</h1>
    <h2>Caleb Willis</h2>
    <h2>This map displays the employment status for the entire state of Virginia on 2018.
        It is interesting to see how the counties with the highest amount of employment are 
        the areas we are likely more familiar with. Namely, Richmond, Washington, and the Chesapeake. This is makes since because
        these areas are the most developed areas and some like Washington and the Chesapeake are able to
        attract tourest and national attention (for example the ecological significance of the Chesapeake bay).
