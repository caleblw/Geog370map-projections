    <h2>This map displays the distribution of individuals above the age of 65 across the United States. The darker colored states are the states with the greatest proportion of elder invividuals in the population. These proportions are in percentages of the total population of the state. The Pie charts compare the individuals of the population who are 18 years old or younger (green) to the elder population (yellow).</h2>
